# 🔐 Permission Debt – Google Drive Access Risk Analyzer

Permission Debt is a web-based security auditing tool that helps users identify **over-shared, risky, and outdated access permissions** in their Google Drive.  
It visualizes **permission decay** by analyzing who has access to files, what level of access they have, and whether that access poses a security risk.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Over time, Google Drive files accumulate **permission debt**:
- Files shared publicly by mistake
- External users retaining access indefinitely
- High-privilege roles (editors/owners) given unnecessarily

These issues increase the risk of **data leakage, compliance violations, and unauthorized access**, especially in collaborative environments.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

Permission Debt provides:
- Secure Google authentication
- Automated permission scanning
- Risk classification (SAFE / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- A clean dashboard with summaries and metrics

The app **does not access file content**, only permission metadata.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User clicks **Login with Google**
2. Firebase Authentication initiates OAuth
3. User grants Drive metadata access
4. App receives an **OAuth access token**
5. Token is used to call Google Drive APIs securely

---

## 📂 Google Drive Permissions Fetching Flow

1. Fetch list of Drive files:

   ```http
   GET /drive/v3/files
   ```

2. For each file, fetch permissions:

   ```http
   GET /drive/v3/files/{fileId}/permissions
   ```

3. Retrieved data:

   * Email address
   * Role (reader / writer / owner)
   * Type (user / domain / anyone)

---

## ⚠️ Risk Analysis Logic

Each permission is evaluated based on:

| Condition                 | Risk Reason         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `type === anyone`         | Publicly accessible |
| External email            | External user       |
| `role === writer / owner` | High privilege      |

### Risk Levels

* 🟢 **SAFE** – Internal + read-only
* 🟠 **MEDIUM** – External OR high privilege
* 🔴 **HIGH** – Multiple risk factors

---

## 📊 Risk Score Calculation

* HIGH risk → +10 points
* MEDIUM risk → +5 points
* Score capped at **100**

This gives users a quick snapshot of their Drive security posture.

---

## 🗂️ Data Storage

Audit results are stored in:

```text
Firestore
└── users
    └── {userId}
        └── permissions
```

Each record includes:

* File name
* Email
* Role
* Risk level
* Risk reasons
* Timestamp

---

* GitHub Pages
* Netlify
* Vercel

Steps:

1. Build the React app
2. Connect repository to hosting platform
3. Add Firebase config & OAuth redirect URLs
4. Deploy
